# T3rn-Executor-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
T3rn is a blockchain project enhancing cross-chain interoperability with fast, secure, and cost-efficient solutions. Built on Polkadot, it offers trustless smart contract bridging, reversible transactions, and a testnet with community incentives like BRN tokens. They've raised $7.8M, reserving 50% of tokens for the community.

## Key Features
- Fast, Secure, and Cost-Efficient Bridging: Optimizes cross-chain transactions using modular layers for storage, validation, settlement, and consensus.
- Trustless Execution: Ensures secure, fail-safe smart contract execution across multiple blockchains without intermediaries.
- Reversible Transactions: Offers a unique fail-safe mechanism, allowing transactions to revert if they fail on any chain, enhancing reliability.
- Interoperable Smart Contracts: Enables seamless smart contract operation across ecosystems like Polkadot, Ethereum (EVM), and WASM-based chains.
- Community Incentives: Rewards users, such as Executors, with BRN tokens for facilitating cross-chain transactions on its testnet.

## Airdrop Details
- You can earn BRN points (burnable to redeem TRN at TGE)
- Reward testnet/mainnet cross-chain participation
- Cost is Free. Only requires testnet tokens (e.g., test ETH from faucets)
- Testnet v2 launched in March 20, 2025
- TGE/mainnet: Planned for 2025 (TBD)

## Funding 
T3rn raised $7.85M from investors like Polychain Capital, IOSG Ventures, and Tribe Capital through seed and strategic rounds (including $6.5M in June 2022). Funds support its Polkadot-based interoperability protocol, testnet development, and community incentives, with 50% of BRN tokens allocated to the community.
